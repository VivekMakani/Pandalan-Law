# Pandalan-Law
A crossplateform application which is solely made in Flutter (Dart).

As a front-end developer for Pandalan Law, I contributed significantly to creating an adaptable educational platform tailored for law students. Leveraging Flutter and Dart, the project features a robust Bloc architecture for organized state management. I optimized the user interface with lazy loading techniques, ensuring a responsive experience. Real-time communication capabilities were integrated using WebSockets, fostering collaborative learning through group settings and chat options. The project emphasizes global accessibility with internationalization practices. My role involved crafting an intuitive and versatile design, showcasing expertise in cross-platform development and front-end design. Pandalan Law stands as a comprehensive study companion for law students, addressing both routine coursework and competitive exam preparation.
